Introduction
------------

This is library for building adminstrative interface on top of Flask framework.

Flask-Admin comes with few batteries out of the box: model scaffolding for `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_,
`MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_ and `Peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_ ORMs and
simple file management interface.

However, you're not limited by provided functionality - instead of providing simple scaffolding for the ORM
models, Flask-Admin provides tools that can be used to build adminstrative interface of any complexity,
using consistent look and feel.

Documentation
-------------

Flask-Admin is extensively documented, you can find `documentation here <http://readthedocs.org/docs/flask-admin>`_.

3rd Party Stuff
---------------

Flask-Admin is built with help of `Twitter Bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_ and `Select2 <https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2>`_.
